# JAVASCRIPT GAME LAB PART 2 - FUNCTIONS

A lab completed for the Grand Circus front end web development boot camp.

## Lab Description

Task: Expand on the game by adding functions that allow the user to start the game and get a number to use as damage.

Functions :

Rearrange your code to include these functions.

1. startGame function. This function will
a. Prompt the user if they would like to play and if they say yes...
i. Allow the user to enter the character’s name.
ii. Call the startCombat function.
2. startCombat function. When executed, this will run the entire loop you created in Part One.
3. getDamage function. This will return a number between one and five that will be used to decide how much damage the user and Grant will deal during each round.

Additional Changes:

1. Each iteration of the loop will include a prompt that will ask the user if they would like to
“attack” or “quit”.
2. If the user decides to attack, adjust the character’s health points and Grant’s health points based on the getDamage function.
3. If the user decides to quit, figure out a way to exit out of the loop and function.
